# MkToPost Project
###### mktopost

## Brief note
<!-- _(Audience, Purpose, Ways it can be accomplished)_: -->
The intent of this project is to provide a simple and easy engine, a kind of thin blog for a user - me -, that will be able to read a text document written with _markdown_ language and publish it on a _html_ style to the web.

## Key objectives
| High-level Objective                              | Priority  | Problems and Concerns                                             | Available Solutions                                                        |
| :-------------                                    | :-------- | :---------                                                        | :------------------------------------------------------------------------  |
| Simple to use webapp and version controlled posts.  | High      | Lost of its simplicity and too much options available is not an idea and must be avoided. | Should not be used as the product here is a self-purpose learning project. |
| A core engine to process a markdown document and provide an html response as a result. | High | Should be OO, simple and fast. | Should be developed. |
| A version controlled directory synced with the documents, posts, created by the user. | Medium | None. | _Git_ must be used. |
| _Docker_ based server to run it. | Low | None. | Docker and a Cloud based server must be used.
